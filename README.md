# Welcome!

This repository is intended to help get you set up for the first time or reinitialize a clean machine.

Thank you for your attention, please help improve this, and enjoy!

First, to set up your machine's identity, run the following in your terminal:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikerikson/onboarding/main/0.ssh.sh | bash
```

This will open a browser window on GitHub that will allow you to add the public key that was generated and written to your console.  This will set you up for using SSH to securely contribute code (Thank you!) and before that in pulling down the relevant code.

After you've added your new key, go ahead and run the following:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikerikson/onboarding/main/1.setup.sh | bash
```

That should give you a baseline setup with which to start coding.  Well... It is, of course, a little more complicated than that...  We need to add you into the systems first.  For now, just ask Erik for help.
